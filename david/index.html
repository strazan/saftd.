      <h2>Your instructor</h2>
    <p>Even though <span class="instructor">Bob James</span> is a longtime ornithologist and field birder, he gets the most pleasure from just sitting at home and seeing which birds happen to fly by. He has a PhD in biology and has served on the board for BirdLife Sverige for fifteen years. By far, one of our most popular courses. </p>

    <p>Bob also teaches the classes "Loving Your Houseplants on a Busy Schedule" and "Do-it-Yourself: Starting a Record Label From the Kitchen Counter." </p>
